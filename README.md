# UTCrypt
Multifunctional cryptographic app

### Usage for common users
- Text and any files encryption with wide choice of cryptographic providers, algorithms, modes, parameters and etc
- Asymmetric encryption and key exchange
- Data hashing

I know that not everyone needs it. Mostly, I develop this app to get skills

### Old versions
You can still find the old versions of UTCrypt. 
Keep in mind:
- The application began to look and feel like an application only since 0.4. Older versions can deservedly be called pre-alpha.
- The old changelog versions are available only in Russian and may cause you to cringe if you can read them. You were warned.
